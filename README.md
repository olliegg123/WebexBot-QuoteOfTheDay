# WebexBot-QuoteOfTheDay
A simple bot that pulls from a quotes API before sending to a pre-defined group of people.

I'd recommend running this on a Cron Job for when you'd like the quote to be sent. I have it daily at 9am.

In the QoD.py file, input your Webex Bot bearer token where it says 'BEARER_TOKEN'.

In the QoD.py file, change the 'emails' list to your own defined list of emails to be sent the quote.
